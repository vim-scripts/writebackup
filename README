DESCRIPTION
This is a poor man's revision control system, a primitive alternative to CVS,
RCS, Subversion, etc., which works with no additional software and almost any
file system.
The :WriteBackup command writes subsequent backups of the current file with a
'current date + counter' file extension (format '.YYYYMMDD[a-z]'). The first
backup of a day has letter 'a' appended, the next 'b', and so on. (So that a
file can be backed up up to 26 times on any given day.)

By default, backups are created in the same directory as the original file,
but they can also be placed in a directory relative to the original file, or
in one common backup directory for all files (similar to Vim's 'backupdir'
option), or even in a file-specific location that is determined via a
user-provided callback function.

SEE ALSO
- The writebackupVersionControl.vim plugin (vimscript #1829) complements
  this script with additional commands and enhances the :WriteBackup command
  with more checks, but is not required.
- The writebackupToAdjacentDir.vim plugin (vimscript #3107) implements a
  WriteBackup-dynamic-backupdir configuration that puts the backup files in
  an adjacent backup directory if one exists. This helps where the backups
  cannot be placed into the same directory.
- The writebackupAutomator.vim plugin (vimscript #3940) automatically writes
  a backup on a day's first write of a file that was backed up in the past,
  but not yet today. It can be your safety net when you forget to make a
  backup.

USAGE
:WriteBackup[!]
                        Write the whole current buffer to the next available
                        backup file with a '.YYYYMMDD[a-z]' file extension.
                        If the last backup is identical with the current
                        buffer contents, no (redundant) backup is written.
                        With [!], creation of a new backup file is forced:
                        - even if the last backup is identical
                        - even when no more backup versions (for this day) are
                          available (the last '.YYYYMMDDz' backup gets
                          overwritten, even if it is readonly)

PS: In addition to this Vim plugin, I also provide the basic writebackup
functionality outside of Vim as VBScript and Bash Shell script versions at
