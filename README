DESCRIPTION
This is a poor man's revision control system, a primitive alternative to CVS,
RCS, Subversion, etc., which works with no additional software and almost any
file system. 
The :WriteBackup command writes subsequent backups of the current file with a
'current date + counter' file extension (format '.YYYYMMDD[a-z]'). The first
backup of a day has letter 'a' appended, the next 'b', and so on. (So that a
file can be backed up up to 26 times on any given day.) 

By default, backups are created in the same directory as the original file,
but they can also be placed in a directory relative to the original file, or
in one common backup directory for all files (similar to Vim's 'backupdir'
option), or even in a file-specific location that is determined via a
user-provided callback function. 

USAGE
:WriteBackup[!]
			Write the whole current buffer to the next available
			backup file with a '.YYYYMMDD[a-z]' file extension. 
			If the last backup is identical with the current
			buffer contents, no (redundant) backup is written. 
			With [!], creation of a new backup file is forced: 
			- even if the last backup is identical
			- even when no more backup versions (for this day) are
			  available (the last '.YYYYMMDDz' backup gets
			  overwritten, even if it is readonly)

PS: In addition to this Vim script, I also provide the basic writebackup
functionality outside of Vim as VBScript and Korn Shell script versions at
